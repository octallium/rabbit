# Branding

There is no specific reason behing naming this project as `Sparrow` , just that I had saved a female sparrow in the past and found the species very interesting.

They are incredible workers and certainly pack a punch for their size and besides they are really `cute`!

## Colors

Thoughts behind choosing brand colors -

1. Black - Essentially symbolizes that this is a `exclusive` product and engineered for a particular `requirement`.
2. Yellow - Operations need to alert, yellow symbolizes `alertness` and `responsiveness` of our teams.
3. Orange - This essentially symbolizes `action` , our teams are always ready to `act` in any situations.
